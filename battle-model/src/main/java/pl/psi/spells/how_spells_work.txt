Info
Spells have cost, school, level, damage, AOE and sometimes special effects. Cost can be decreased by learning magic from elemental school. Damage can be increased by gaining wisdom.

Casting
Spells can be casted by both Heroes and creatures. While all Heroes can learn spells, creatures can't learn and can cast only spells from preexisting pool.
The power of spell depends on wisdom. Like with learning spells, Heroes can gain skill Wisdom (basic <- most heroes have it at start, advanced, expert) and creatures have some wisdom (also assigned and not changeable).
Wisdom is important as it limits the level of spells Hero can learn and the output of spell*. Basic wisdom is equal to 3 lvl spells at best, advanced - 4 and expert - 5. Heroes without wisdom can learn only 1 and 2 lvl spells.
Higher wisdom = better effect and/or higher damage.
*If hero has assigned skill with higher lvl than wisdom at start, it can still cast this spell.

School
Each spell is assigned to 1 elemental (fire, water, earth, air) school with exception of Magic Bolt and Visions (these two can be assigned to any school aka universal spells).
If Hero learns magic from elemental school, it automatically decreases the cost of spells only from this school by its' level,
e.g. Hero learned fire magic from school of fire and knows Fireball (fire, 3 lvl spell) which normally costs 15 Spell Points, now it costs only 12 Spell Points but Ice Bolt (water, 2 lvl spell) still costs 8 SP as it's not fire spell but water.

Vulnerability
Some creatures get more damage when attacked by spells of opposite or the same element. It's really easy to understand, it's like this:
- Air beats Air,
- Earth beats Earth,
- Water beats Fire,
- Fire beats Water.
With immunities, it's complicated as some creatures are immune to specific statuses while others are immune to all 1-4 lvl spells (more info here: https://heroes.thelazy.net/index.php/Spell_immunity)
